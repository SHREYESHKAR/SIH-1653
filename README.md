## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

# Idea :
Resume Review: Implement an AI-driven resume review system where users (selectors) can score resumes based on a variety of criteria like qualifications, keywords, or work experience.
Interview Simulation: Use a chat-based or video-based interview system where the applicant responds to predefined questions, and the selector can score the answers. Mock Interviews for Applicants: Applicants can simulate interviews and receive feedback on their responses (e.g., how well they handle stress, how clear their answers are). Virtual Job Fair: Simulate job fairs where applicants can interact with selectors in a mock environment, practicing their networking and interviewing skills. Skill Tests: Create simulations where applicants can take skills tests (coding challenges, aptitude tests, etc.) to assess their practical abilities. 
Allow applicants to submit their resumes and cover letters through the platform. Simulate
real-world job posting and application processes with features for uploading resumes and
attaching documents. You could implement an AI-driven resume parser to extract key
details (e.g., qualifications, experience).
Automated Screening Tools: Implement resume scoring based on criteria defined in the job
description (e.g., education, experience, skills). AI could score and rank applicants
automatically based on keyword matching or predefined skills.
Manual Screening Simulation: Allow selectors to manually review resumes, rate candidates
based on specific criteria, and flag interesting applicants. Provide a space for notes and
comments.
